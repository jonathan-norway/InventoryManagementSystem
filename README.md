# InventoryManagementSystem

A grocery store chain called North Mountain Groceries has three grocery stores spread throughout Thames county and needs a new inventory management program. They have been having delivery problems, and the delivery company does not distribute the products equally between the different locations. This is not a big problem for most products, but for perishables like fresh produce this is a huge problem. Some stores get sold out almost immediately, while others have way too much and end up having to throw away spoiled food. 

North Mountain Groceries needs an easy-to-use web application, with a good manual, and the ability to add more locations down the line.
